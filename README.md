## Description about the course
In early 2016, Python passed Java as the #1 beginners language in the world. Why? It's because it's simple enough for beginners yet advanced enough for the pros. 

<b>SpaceX</b> uses it to launch Rockets

<b>Pixar</b> uses Python to run their animation software

<b>Instagram</b> & <b>Pinterest</b> use it to run their web application (backend via Django)

#### What is Python ?<br>
Python is currently one of my favorite and most preferred language to work on because of its simple text, powerful libraries(which has been used in Machine Learning), and readability . You may be an old school coder or may be completely new to programming, Python is the best way to get started!. 
<br>
Python provides features listed below :
-Simplicity: Think less of the syntax of the language and more of the code.
- Open Source: A powerful language and it is free for everyone to use and alter as needed.
- Portability: Python code can be shared and it would work the same way it was intended to. Seamless and hassle-free.
- Being Embeddable & Extensible: Python can have snippets of other languages inside it to perform certain functions.
- Being Interpreted: The worries of large memory tasks and other heavy CPU tasks are taken care of by Python itself leaving you to worry only about coding.
- Huge amount of libraries: Data Science? Python has you covered. Web Development? Python still has you covered. Always.
- Object Orientation: Objects help breaking-down complex real-life problems into such that they can be coded and solved to obtain solutions.
